        <p class="white">
            The design of this portfolio is based on the <a href="https://musicforprogramming.net/latest/" class="green text-decoration-none">MusicForProgramming();</a>  website.

            I use this site a lot, and I liked its design so much that I wanted to use it as inspiration to create my
            portfolio.
